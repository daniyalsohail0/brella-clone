        </div>
        <div class="blog-section">
          <span><p>Your choice of virtual event platform is essential for setting the proper environment for your event.</p>

<p>You are the expert in content and presentation, but what provides an excellent event experience and interaction opportunities for your audience is your <a href="../virtual-event-platform.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>virtual event platform</strong></a>.</p>
<p>However, not every virtual event platform is made with your sponsors in mind.</p>
<p>So are you helping them achieve maximum ROI through the best experience possible? Or are you leaving value on the table?</p>
<p>Here are some definite ways your virtual event platform <em>isn’t</em> giving the best experience possible for your sponsors.</p>
<h2>Complicated registration process</h2>
<p>A poor or complicated registration process can set the tone for the entirety of your event.</p>
<p>Your sponsors are busy and don’t have time to learn the intricacies of complicated tools.</p>
<p>The more hoops to jump through to access your virtual event platform, the more barriers you put in front of them.</p>
<p>They’ll be loath to use the platform and won’t make the most of the incredible opportunity you’re providing them.</p>
<h2>Lack of effective data and reporting on ROI</h2>
<p>Virtual events offer potential for immense amounts of information for both you and your sponsors.</p>
<p>But the information should also be provided to you in a way you can understand.</p>
<p>Anyone can spend hours of time analyzing endless spreadsheets and calculating numbers manually, but what you need is the right data shown the right way.</p>
<p>As well, some virtual event platforms only report on vanity metrics, which is a kind way of saying ‘metrics that don’t matter’.</p>
<p>Vanity metrics can be dangerous. Your sponsors want quantifiable results from their participation.</p>
<p>And to get those results, they don’t need banner ad views, they need to know how many attendees took action because of that ad.</p>
<p>Most of all, they need real data on buyer intent (bonus if you can provide qualified leads too).</p>
<p>So beware of virtual event platforms that only offer vanity metrics, as these lack true revenue-generating value for sponsors.</p>
<h2>Unintuitive platform for attendees</h2>
<p>Your attendees are the only reason sponsors participate in your event.</p>
<p>So if your virtual event platform isn’t enticing for attendees, they won’t use it.</p>
<p>And if they aren’t using it, they won’t connect with your sponsors.</p>
<p>How do you know if the platform will be difficult for attendees to use? Keep an eye out for these warning flags:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Poor accessibility.</strong> Attendees should be able to participate from different platforms and devices.</li>
<li><strong>Difficult registration process. </strong>Sign up should be painless and easy, like clicking a link or receiving a sign in email.</li>
<li><strong>Confusing and cluttered user interfaces. </strong>A bad user interface can mean your attendees get lost or miss valuable information.</li>
</ul>
<h2>No meeting scheduler or facilitated matchmaking</h2>
<p>The best way to close a deal is an in-person meeting, but a 1:1 video call will serve just as well.</p>
<p>So when your sponsors find a hot lead, the faster they schedule a direct meeting, the better.</p>
<p>But if you can’t offer an easy way to schedule meetings or find potential leads, you’re leaving a lot of value on the table and limiting the effectiveness of your sponsorship offering.</p>
<p>By adding facilitated matchmaking to your event, you help both sponsors and attendees find the right people to meet.</p>
<p><a href="../event-matchmaking.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Facilitated matchmaking</strong></a> or meeting schedulers are your sponsors’ ticket to approaching leads and generating revenue - so don’t neglect them!</p>

<h2>Uneven promotional opportunities</h2>
<p>Attendees don’t want to join a living pop-up ad. Your virtual event platform needs to balance out your sponsor needs with the attendee experience.</p>
<p>Some attendees participate to find solutions to issues. These can be your sponsors’ products or services, so promoting your sponsors will help those attendees achieve their goals.</p>
<p>However, they don’t want sponsors in front of their face, preventing them from enjoying the other aspects of your event either.</p>
<p>There’s a delicate balance. We recommend virtual event platforms that offer native promotion for sponsors, as this provides great visibility for sponsors while maintaining a positive attendee experience.</p>
<p>And while you should offer your sponsors the freedom to promote their brand, too much can be bad. It’s your event after all – you should have the final say on what happens and when.</p>
<p>So be careful of giving sponsors too much freedom and flexibility. You should always be able to moderate and control what goes on at your event.</p>

<p>As you can see, there are a lot of things that can go wrong!</p>
<p>However, striking the perfect balance takes time. Your event and brand will determine the optimal amount of control and promotion for your sponsors.</p>
<p>For example, the level of appropriate promotion for sponsors is greater at a trade show, where the focus is on new products and services, compared to a conference, which is more about connections, content and discussions.</p>
<p>So when testing virtual event platforms and the sponsor applications for your own event, ask yourself these four questions:</p>
<h2>Is it easy to use and understand?</h2>
<p>Your sponsors are busy people (like you). Lengthy onboarding process or unnecessary downloads to join the platform are huge turn-offs.</p>
<p>The best virtual event platforms are simple and intuitive.</p>
<p>While the term ‘virtual event platform’ sounds intimidating, at their core they aren’t too different from popular social media platforms - people use them to connect with others, and expect to do it with ease.</p>
<p>Those have incredibly simple sign in and registration flows, and virtual event platforms should be the same.</p>
<p>Make sure your virtual event platform is easy to use, for both you and your sponsors.</p>
<p>The more your sponsors use the platform and the tools provided, the better their experience will be - but they have to use it first!</p>
<h2>Is it versatile enough to cater to my sponsors’ needs?</h2>
<p>Your sponsors come with different reasons and values, and you do your best to provide them with a reasonable and effective package to help them achieve your goals.</p>
<p>So you deserve a virtual event platform that’s like yourself - flexible and ready to go above and beyond.</p>
<p>Your virtual event platform should be able to cover (at minimum) the most common reasons for sponsorship, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lead generation</li>
<li>Brand awareness</li>
<li>New product launch</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise, you’re limiting the potential of your sponsorships and your event.</p>
<p>My colleague researched the most common questions sponsors need you to answer. <a href="virtual-sponsor-questions-you-need-to-answer.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I invite you to read more here.</a></p>
<h2>Does it offer potential for continuous revenue generation?</h2>
<p>Digital experiences are all the rage, and the best thing about them is they can exist even when there are no people around.</p>
<p>Consider a booth at a physical event. No reps means no deals.</p>
<p>However, at a virtual event, good virtual event platforms allow sponsors to generate leads and revenue even when they aren’t present at the booth.</p>
<p>Whether it’s through lead capture forms or capturing booth traffic, you and your sponsors have data that physical events cannot provide.</p>
<p>So use a critical eye when evaluating the sponsor features of your virtual event platform. Look for potentials to add:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Passive lead gen opportunities</strong> like sign-up forms, newsletter registrations or gated content</li>
<li><strong>Full branding</strong> to make it as sponsor-friendly as possible</li>
<li><strong>Content</strong> like brand videos, product demos or whitepapers</li>
</ul>
<p>And much more.</p>
<h2>Does it provide the right data to prove ROI?</h2>
<p>Virtual event platforms offer your sponsors quantifiable information on their participation.</p>
<p>For example, instead of guessing how much traffic they had, they’ll know exactly who visited their booth and the actions they took.</p>
<p>This helps your sponsors segment attendees who requested more information from those who visited their booth but left without requesting more information.</p>
<p>As well, you can provide exact numbers on traffic to sponsored sessions, leads generated from sessions and booths, and more.</p>
<p>Buyer intent, lead generation, session participation, content effectiveness - if your sponsor wants to know, your virtual event platform should be able to tell them.</p>
<p>Effective reporting is a vital feature of any virtual event platform (aside from connecting your attendees together in a simple, effective manner).</p>
<h2>Provide worthwhile opportunities to your sponsors</h2>
<p>Virtual events offer great lead generation potential for your sponsors, due to the larger reach your event has, and the more powerful lead capture options available online.</p>
<p>And with detailed reporting, your sponsors will gain more data than would ever be possible at a live event.</p>
<p>Plus, getting familiar with these features and possibilities now will assist you greatly as hybrid events become more mainstream.</p>
