          <span><h2><strong><a href="hybrid-event-benefits.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hybrid events are essential to your future event strategy.</a></strong></h2>

<p>It's a bold claim, but <a href="https://www.bizbash.com/production-strategy/event-production-fabrication/article/21173599/meetings-are-still-happening-around-the-country-heres-what-they-look-like" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hybrid events are already happening and succeeding</a>, maybe even in a location near you.</p>
<p>Hybrid events, while certainly requiring more implementation, offer a ton of benefits that far outweigh the cost, like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Expanded reach.</strong> From those who haven't heard of you to those who have thought about attending for a while, a virtual component makes participation simple.</li>
<li><strong>Greater data and analytics.</strong> To grow and improve, you need to understand the areas where you thrive and where you lack. Adding a virtual component opens up immense data capture potential for your event.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility for your participants.</strong> The main draw of your event will always be the experience, and offering a virtual component won't threaten that. Instead, your attendees can join in a way that suits them best.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, a common question we get is...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How does networking work at hybrid events?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Getting networking right is <em>essential</em> for hybrid events.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, when you host a hybrid event, <strong>you are connecting a physical and a virtual event together.</strong></p>
<p>You stream your content from your physical venue to your virtual venue, and the audience interacts with it, via Q&amp;A software, polling software or live chat.</p>
<p>In short, both audiences connect and engage with each other.</p>
<p><amp-img src="../hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-013d53.png?width=1567&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-01.png" alt="Brella-hybrid-event-01" width="1567.0" srcset="https://www.brella.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-01.png?width=784&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-01.png 784w, https://www.brella.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-01.png?width=1567&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-01.png 1567w, https://www.brella.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-01.png?width=2351&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-01.png 2351w, https://www.brella.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-01.png?width=3134&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-01.png 3134w, https://www.brella.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-01.png?width=3918&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-01.png 3918w, https://www.brella.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-01.png?width=4701&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-01.png 4701w" height="480.0" layout="responsive"></amp-img></p>
<p>However, what happens when your stream ends? Your audience loses that connection.</p>
<p>Your physical audience can rely on random encounters, coffee breaks and more for interactions, but what about your virtual participants?</p>
<p><amp-img src="../hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-02d9b2.png?width=1709&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-02.png" alt="Brella-hybrid-event-02" width="1709.0" srcset="https://www.brella.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-02.png?width=855&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-02.png 855w, https://www.brella.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-02.png?width=1709&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-02.png 1709w, https://www.brella.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-02.png?width=2564&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-02.png 2564w, https://www.brella.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-02.png?width=3418&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-02.png 3418w, https://www.brella.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-02.png?width=4273&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-02.png 4273w, https://www.brella.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-02.png?width=5127&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-02.png 5127w" height="685.0" layout="responsive"></amp-img></p>
<p>By adding <a href="../event-matchmaking.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>facilitated networking</strong></a> to the mix, you give <em>real </em>interaction and engagement to your audiences.</p>
<p>It ensures both audiences can break the barriers and connect with anyone, no matter where they are.</p>
<p><amp-img src="../hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-0328b0.png?width=2008&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-03.png" alt="Brella-hybrid-event-03" width="2008.0" srcset="https://www.brella.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-03.png?width=1004&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-03.png 1004w, https://www.brella.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-03.png?width=2008&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-03.png 2008w, https://www.brella.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-03.png?width=3012&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-03.png 3012w, https://www.brella.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-03.png?width=4016&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-03.png 4016w, https://www.brella.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-03.png?width=5020&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-03.png 5020w, https://www.brella.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-03.png?width=6024&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-03.png 6024w" height="685.0" layout="responsive"></amp-img></p>
<p>Plus, facilitated networking helps save time for both physical and virtual attendees.</p>
<p>Instead of typical 30 minute or 1 hour demo calls, your attendees can have three 15 minute focused meetings in one hour (including 5 minute breaks in between).</p>
<p>Quite simply: <strong>N</strong><strong>etworking is essential to keep your audience engaged, no matter when or where your content is.</strong></p>
<p><amp-img src="../hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-046ae1.png?width=2008&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-04.png" alt="Brella-hybrid-event-04" width="2008.0" srcset="https://www.brella.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-04.png?width=1004&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-04.png 1004w, https://www.brella.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-04.png?width=2008&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-04.png 2008w, https://www.brella.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-04.png?width=3012&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-04.png 3012w, https://www.brella.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-04.png?width=4016&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-04.png 4016w, https://www.brella.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-04.png?width=5020&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-04.png 5020w, https://www.brella.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-04.png?width=6024&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-04.png 6024w" height="685.0" layout="responsive"></amp-img></p>

</amp-iframe> includes everything you need to know.</p>
<p>Let's get into it!</p>
<h2>1. Provide a central location for all attendees to meet online</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, you need to connect two audiences together.</p>
<p>After all, segmenting your audience makes for a poor networking experience.</p>
<p>But how can you provide one location for both your physical and virtual audience?</p>
<p>Well, the best way is by using a <a href="../virtual-event-platform.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">virtual or hybrid event platform</a> that all attendees can access during the event.</p>
<p>Your virtual participants join through their desktop devices, and physical attendees through their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Even if they can’t be together face-to-face, they can still interact with each other and connect in this online forum.</p>
<p>Plus, a good <a href="../virtual-event-platform.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">virtual event platform</a> solves many other problems, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hosting your livestream in a distraction-free environment</li>
<li>Ensuring attendees have easy access to all your event information</li>
<li>Giving you the opportunity to send reminders and notifications to your audience</li>
</ul>
<p>Using a virtual event platform as your central location for all attendees is essential for hybrid events. For networking, of course, but for many other reasons too!</p>
<h2>2. Offer a matchmaking service for all participants</h2>
<p>Networking is so easy for your physical audience - they have the benefit of social cues, body language, and more to determine context and have a good meeting.</p>
<p>Not to mention, serendipity is in their favor!</p>
<p>Your virtual participants have it a bit tougher. After all, <a href="https://www.lifesize.com/en/video-conferencing-blog/speaking-without-words" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anywhere from 70 to 93 percent of communication is non-verbal</a>, meaning that it can be difficult to communicate effectively while having online meetings - and they need to get a meeting in the first place.</p>
<p>So to ensure your virtual participants have a worthwhile networking experience, you need to help them find <strong>relevant</strong> meetings.</p>
<p>While physical participants can rely on serendipity and social cues to meet new people, virtual participants are limited to the information they see on their screen.</p>
<p>That means it can be downright awkward to meet new people without knowing a thing about them beforehand.</p>
<p>By offering participants the opportunity to search the attendee list with a meaningful filter - either job title, company, interests or more - you offer them <strong>valuable context</strong>, which helps them make a better first impression.</p>
<p><amp-img src="../hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-077d8e6.png?width=1591&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-077.png" alt="Brella-hybrid-event-077" width="1591.0" srcset="https://www.brella.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-077.png?width=796&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-077.png 796w, https://www.brella.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-077.png?width=1591&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-077.png 1591w, https://www.brella.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-077.png?width=2387&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-077.png 2387w, https://www.brella.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-077.png?width=3182&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-077.png 3182w, https://www.brella.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-077.png?width=3978&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-077.png 3978w, https://www.brella.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-077.png?width=4773&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-077.png 4773w" height="913.0" layout="responsive"></amp-img></p>
<p>Better yet, try <a href="../event-matchmaking.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">facilitated matchmaking</a>, as this proactively provides the most relevant matches for each attendee. No need to search!</p>
<h2>3. Provide separate meeting areas for physical and hybrid meetings</h2>
<p>It can be tough to have a good meeting during the hubbub of events, which is why we recommend having an area solely dedicated to networking meetings.</p>
<p>And whenever possible, offer a separate meeting area for participants with virtual meetings too.</p>
<p>For a great hybrid meeting area, you’ll require at least:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Power outlets for charging devices. </strong>This prevents last minute panic and delays because of a low battery.</li>
<li><strong>Solid Wi-Fi. </strong>Nothing is more agonizing than trying to have a conversation with someone who is breaking up every 5 seconds.</li>
<li><strong>Desks, chairs, standing tables, or anything to make the physical participants comfortable</strong>. They’ll have a more productive meeting when they’re relaxed.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are also good additions for your physical meeting area, but not necessary.</p>
<p><amp-img src="../hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-06c1d7.png?width=1102&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-06.png" alt="Brella-hybrid-event-06" width="1102.0" srcset="https://www.brella.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-06.png?width=551&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-06.png 551w, https://www.brella.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-06.png?width=1102&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-06.png 1102w, https://www.brella.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-06.png?width=1653&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-06.png 1653w, https://www.brella.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-06.png?width=2204&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-06.png 2204w, https://www.brella.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-06.png?width=2755&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-06.png 2755w, https://www.brella.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Brella-hybrid-event-06.png?width=3306&amp;name=Brella-hybrid-event-06.png 3306w" height="685.0" layout="responsive"></amp-img></p>
<p>Your virtual participants will most likely be participating from the comfort of their home, so your physical participants deserve at least some level of comfort.</p>
<p>Having the meeting area in a quiet, secluded part of your venue (if possible) will ensure that the meeting is a positive experience for both parties.</p>
<h2>4. Educate your attendees on hybrid meeting best practices</h2>
<p>While most of us are familiar with video conferencing tools by now (perhaps overly familiar), there are a few meeting tips that are still worth mentioning to your audience:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ensure Wi-Fi has bandwidth for your meeting. </strong>Encourage your participants to keep internet use to a minimum while having meetings. (In other words, don’t stream Netflix while trying to have a conversation!)</li>
<li><strong>Get into a proper environment.</strong> Good lighting can do wonders for a meeting. As well, reducing the reverb in a room improves audio quality.</li>
<li><strong>Use headphones and a mic if possible.</strong> Both participants should use headphones and a mic if possible, as it improves audio quality and ensures that the conversation doesn't disrupt others.</li>
</ul>
<p>These aren’t necessary, but they will drastically improve the quality of the meeting.</p>
<p>They can focus on learning about each other instead of asking “Sorry, you broke up a bit, could you repeat that?” over and over again.</p>
<p>Also, communicating the benefits of hybrid meetings can boost the connectivity between your two audiences.</p>
<p>Your physical participants may forget there are interesting people to meet virtually - and vice versa.</p>
<p>When you combine the power of meeting the right person with the amazing content you're providing, well, that's the secret sauce to a dynamic event!</p>
<h2>5. Leave transition times between meetings</h2>
<p>Breaks are essential for good hybrid meetings (and hybrid events in general). Your virtual audience needs structured breaks in the program.</p>
<p>A physical participant has a lot of opportunity to be active, stretch their limbs, and engage with others. One of the many benefits of attending physically!</p>
<p>However, the most your virtual participants need to move to get to their next meeting is their wrist and fingers.</p>
<p>So they need those reminders to get up and stretch their legs, go to the bathroom, or just stare out the window for a moment.</p>
<p>Offering 5 minutes between meetings allow both participants to get to their next meeting, while also ensuring they have some buffer time to keep talking if the conversation is going super well.</p>
<h2>6. Facilitate serendipity for virtual participants</h2>
<p>It’s important to remember that a hybrid event means you have two separate audiences, and they’ll take different journeys at your event.</p>
<p>And it’s perfectly okay if your audiences interact separately.</p>
<p>For physical attendees, there is watercooler talk, chance encounters and other moments of serendipity that they’ll grab as they happen.</p>
<p>For virtual attendees, however, serendipity needs to be engineered.</p>
<p>Here are some great ways to inject some serendipity for your virtual attendees:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Structured virtual networking.</strong> This could be a speed dating type affair that involves only your virtual participants.</li>
<li><strong>Virtual breakout sessions.&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Post-stream and end-of-event recaps.</strong> While your physical audience mingles between keynotes, offer a structured recap for further virtual engagement.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus tip – keep networking open after your event ends</h2>
<p>Your event may end, but the potential for connections doesn’t.</p>
<p>Many virtual event platforms allow you to offer structured networking for a few days after your event program ends.</p>
<p>This allows your physical attendees to travel back home and have a virtual meeting in their own environment.</p>
<p>It also allows all your participants to network on their own schedule, which is a huge benefit and draw of virtual events.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, digital platforms and experience benefit more from repeat usage, meaning that stretching your networking over a few days ensures your participants have more interactions with your brand.</p>
<h2>Bring your hybrid audiences together</h2>
<p>If you don’t connect your physical and virtual audiences together, you aren’t hosting a hybrid event.</p>
<p>You’re livestreaming your physical event, plain and simple.</p>
<p>Audience interaction and participation is essential for a hybrid event, and networking is one of the easiest ways to bring your participants together.</p>
<p>And a good <a href="../virtual-event-platform.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">virtual event platform</a> solves the issue of where to gather your attendees and how to connect them.</p>
