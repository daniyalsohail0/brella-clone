          <span><p>Event organizers are hosting more complex and immersive hybrid, virtual and in-person events using Brella. We have always strived to make organizers’ lives easier, more profitable and productive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On that note, we are excited to announce the upcoming launch of Brella's highly anticipated Access Control functionality!</p>

<p><span>Access Control is our take on offering busy event organizers more granular control over their event’s sessions, streams and networking options — with minimal effort. This means:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brand new monetization opportunities</strong> — Access control makes it easy to deliver tailored experiences to each attendee, depending on their ticket-type, enabling organizers to get creative with their monetization options!</li>
<li><strong>Unique experiences to sponsor representatives, VIPs and the media</strong> — Segment these attendees into groups using Access Control, and provide highly exclusive streams and networking access to them.</li>
<li><strong>Simpler management of complex hybrid events with many moving parts</strong> — Access control makes it easier than ever to deliver the right experiences to attendees based on their mode of attendance (hybrid, in-person or virtual).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Release plan</h2>
<p>We plan to introduce the first iteration of Brella's Access Control functionality in three parts, which are scheduled for release during the latter half of Q3 2021:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>V1.0 User Groups:</strong> Mid / Late August</li>
<li><strong>V2.0 Stream Rules:</strong> Late Q3 (estimated)</li>
<li><strong>V3.0 Networking Rules:</strong> Late Q3 (estimated)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s take a quick look at what each of these features bring to the table.</p>
<h2>User Groups (V1.0)</h2>
<p><em>User Groups</em> empowers organizers to easily segment attendees into two types of <em>groups</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Default Groups: </strong>These groups are pre-determined based on the event type selected in Brella (hybrid, virtual or in-person):<br>
<ul>
<li>For example, a hybrid event would offer six default groups (consisting of separate virtual, hybrid and in-person groups for both attendees and sponsors).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>These default groups cannot be deleted (although, event organizers can easily move people between them and <em>custom groups</em>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Custom Groups:</strong> Organizers can freely name these groups, and add attendees to each group based <em>on any custom criteria</em> you may have.<br>
<ul>
<li>Some potential applications include segmenting attendees by ticket type, having a group for VIP attendees, press / media or even <em>location </em>(for hybrid / in-person events that are spread throughout multiple locations).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At launch, all attendees will be added to a single, default group based on the selected event type.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The addition of user groups will also improve the attendee networking experience by automatically determining whether to offer a pair of attendees a table assignment (if available), or video meeting room for their meeting, based on each attendee's mode of attendance (derived from their assigned user group).</p>
<p><span>Ultimately, the User Groups feature will form the foundation for applying granular rules and controls that determine attendee access to various parts of the Brella platform.</span></p>
<p><em>The ability to actually gate content or networking features to specific user groups will be available with the launch of Access Control V2.0 and V3.0.</em></p>
<h2>Stream Gating (V2.0)</h2>
<p><em>Stream gating</em> is the first application of the Access Control feature. This release enables organizers to offer specific user groups controlled access to event streams. This means that organizers can sell v<span>ariably priced in-person, virtual and hybrid ticket tiers, which would have differing levels of access to an event's streams and content.</span></p>
<p>Stream gating is scheduled for release in late Q3.</p>
<h2>Networking Rules (V3.0)</h2>
<p><em>Networking gating </em>completes our initial implementation of the access control feature, by empowering organizers to offer attendees varying levels of access to Brella’s flagship feature: AI-powered networking.</p>
<p>The design of this feature is currently underway, but we anticipate a late Q3 release date.</p></span>
